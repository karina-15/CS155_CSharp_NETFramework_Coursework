## Instructions
> Write a program that will print out statistics for eight coin tosses.  
> The user will input either an “h” for heads or a “t” for tails for the  
> eight tosses. The program will then print out the total number and  
> percentages of heads and tails. Use the increment operator to increment  
> the number of tosses as each toss is input. For example, a possible  
> sample dialog might be:  
> 
> For each coin toss enter either ‘h’ for heads or ‘t’ for tails.  
> First toss: h  
> Second toss: t  
> Third toss: t  
> Fourth toss: h  
> Fifth toss: t  
> Sixth toss: h  
> Seventh toss: t  
> Eighth toss: t

> Number of heads: 3  
> Number of tails: 5  
> Percent heads:  37.5  
> Percent tails:   62.5
