> WPF GUI for monthly mortgage payment

## Screenshot

## Instructions
> Write a GUI program that reads in the amount of a monthly mortgage  
> payment and the outstanding balance (i.e., the amount still owed) and  
> then outputs the amount of the payment that goes to interest and the  
> amount that goes to principal (i.e., the amount that goes to reducing  
> the debt). Assume that the annual interest payment is 6.39 percent. Use  
> a defined constant for the interest rate. Note that payments are made  
> monthly, so the interest is only one-twelfth of the annual interest rate  
> of 6.39 percent.
