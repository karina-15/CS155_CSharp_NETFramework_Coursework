## Instructions
> Copy the Bubble Sort and Selection Sort code and test it.  
> Use the debugger and step through the code and understand how it progress  
> see if you can guess each step through the code.  
> Time Limit: ?

> **Selection Sort**  
> Selection sort is relatively easy to understand  
> It sorts an array by making several passes through the array, selecting  
> the next smallest item in the array each time and placing it where it  
> belongs in the array  
> While the sort algorithms are not limited to arrays, throughout we will  
> sort arrays for simplicity
---
> **Bubble Sort**  
> Also a quadratic sort  
> Compares adjacent array elements and exchanges their values if they are  
> out of order  
> Smaller values bubble up to the top of the array and larger values sink  
> to the bottom; hence the name
