## Instructions
> Create a program that will store any arbitrary number of coin flips.  
> Letâ€™s say 8 as a starting point (make this a constant).  
> Write a program that randomly flips a coin that number of times  
> (the arbitrary number).  
> At the end show the history of all the coin flips and compute a percentage  
> for that.  
> Next expand this up to 10000 as the number of coin flips.
