## Instructions
> Modify the MyFirstProgram.cs file so that it adds three integers instead  
> of two. Store the sum of the three numbers in a variable. Compile the  
> program so that you receive no compiler error messages and then run it.  
> Modify the MyFirstProgram.cs file so that it also multiplies the same three  
> numbers and stores the result in a variable.  
> Divide the sum of the three numbers by the product of the same three numbers.  
> Test your program. Do not use the same number 3 times nor the numbers  
> 1, 2 or 3 as input.
