> United States for the year 2003 as compiled by the Social Security  
> Administration.  
> These are blank-delimited files where the most popular name is listed  
> first, the second most popular second, and so on to the 1000th most popular  
> name which is listed last.  Each line consists of the first name followed by  
> a blank space and then the number of registered births using that name in  
> the year.  For example the girlnames.txt file begins with:  
> 
> Emily 25494  
> Emma 22532

> namings, Emma was the second most popular with 22532, and Madison was the  
> third most popular with 19986.

> Write a program that reads both the girl’s and boy’s files into memory  
> using a dictionary.  The key should be the name and value should be a user  
> defined object which is the count and rank of the name.  
> Allow the user to input a name, the program should find the name in the  
> dictionary and print out the rank and the number of namings.  If the name  
> isn’t a key in the dictionary then the program should note this and say  
> that no match exists.  
> 
> If the user enters the name “Walter”, then the program should output:  
> 
> Walter is not ranked among the top 1000 girl names.
